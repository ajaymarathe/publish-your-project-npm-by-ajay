# publish-your-project-npm-by-ajay
Hi There, it's just small docs to explore how to publish your project npm, Thanks :)

## docs 

- hit this command `npm login`
- login with your npm login id and password.
- then hit this command `npm init` This command runs you through a few questions and creates a package.json file for you at the end. This package.json file contains the bare necessities you need to publish your project. (Feel free to skip questions that donâ€™t make sense).
- Finally hit this command `npm publish`

## commnads to hit

`
  npm login,
  npm init,
  npm publish,
`


- hope this helps :)
